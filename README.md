# ARM Wiz

## Overview
The goal of the ARM Wiz project is to create a system that easily generates STM32 ARM microcontroller projects using command line tools. This is a fork of [Iztok Starc's original repository](https://github.com/istarc/stm32) and at this point is entirely Iztok's work. Over time we hope to extend his project and generalize the system to support additional microcontroller and boards beyond the STM32F4-Discovery board.

## File Organization

- [examples](https://github.com/istarc/stm32/tree/master/examples) - Example projects
- [freertos](https://github.com/istarc/freertos) - FreeRTOS as a git submodule that is not tracked in this repository. It is automatically downloaded from https://github.com/PaxInstruments/freertos.
- [mbed](http://mbed.org/) - mbed as a git submodule that is not tracked in this repository. It is automatically downloaded from https://github.com/mbedmicro/mbed.
- [mbed-project-wizard](http://istarc.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/stm32f4-behold-the-project-wizard/) - A wizard that generates STM32 project templates.
- [STM32F4-Discovery_FW_V1.1.0 library](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM116/SC959/SS1532/PF252419) library

## Usage
